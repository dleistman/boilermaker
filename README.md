# Know Your Election

Know Your Election is an online quiz game that anyone can play in the browser. Players are given a blank map and a year, and are challenged to recreate that yearâ€™s election map from memory. After getting familiar with a few solo rounds, players can jump into a room online to play collaboratively with friends.

Don Leistman created this app using the data visualization library D3 to render an interactive map of the US, socket.io for real-time multiplayer interactions, and both server and client-side Redux stores to keep track of the game state.
